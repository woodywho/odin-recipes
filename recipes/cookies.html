    <h3>Soft cut out sugar cookie that I have used for years. I sprinkle with colored sugar before baking or you could also try icing them when cool. </h3>

        <li>1tsp baking poweder</li>

        <li>1 cup margarine softened</li>

        <li>Sift flour, baking powder, and salt together, set aside. In a large bowl, cream together the margarine and sugar until light and fluffy.
